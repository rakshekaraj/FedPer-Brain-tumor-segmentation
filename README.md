# FedPer - Brain Tumor Segmentation

Federated learning framework for brain tumor segmentation to ensure patient privacy. This project utilizes the **lgg-MRI segmentation dataset** and a **ResNet model**. A Federated Learning pipeline is introduced to maintain patient privacy while achieving comparable accuracy to centralized learning.

## üìö **Introduction**

Accurate brain tumor segmentation from MRI scans is essential for clinical decision-making, enabling detailed assessment and planning of treatments. However, datasets required for robust segmentation models are often distributed across institutions, making centralized data collection infeasible due to privacy concerns.

**Federated Learning** offers a solution by enabling institutions to collaboratively train models without centralizing data. However, challenges such as data heterogeneity across institutions persist. 

This project employs **FedPer** to address these challenges by personalizing models while sharing global knowledge. The project evaluates **FedPer** against traditional centralized learning to balance privacy with model performance.

## üìñ **Related Work**

- **Traditional Methods**: Deep learning models like UNet (Ronneberger et al., 2015) and Mask R-CNN have shown success in brain tumor segmentation but rely on centralized data.
- **Federated Learning**: Studies (e.g., Kairouz et al., 2021) highlight federated learning as a privacy-preserving alternative. However, handling non-IID data remains a challenge.
- **FedPer**: Proposed by Karimireddy et al. (2020), FedPer personalizes models by sharing global knowledge while retaining institution-specific expertise.

This project extends prior work by integrating **FedPer** with **3D brain tumor segmentation**, an area yet to be extensively explored.

## ‚öôÔ∏è **Technical Approach**

### 1Ô∏è‚É£ **Data Preparation and Local Training**
- MRI scans from the **BraTS dataset** are preprocessed locally by each institution.
- Each client trains a **3D UNet model** for brain tumor segmentation with pixel-wise annotations.

### 2Ô∏è‚É£ **Federated Model Aggregation with FedPer**
- **Shared Encoder**: The encoder is shared across institutions to capture global knowledge.
- **Personalized Segmentation Heads**: Each institution maintains its own segmentation head to retain domain-specific knowledge.

### 3Ô∏è‚É£ **Global Model Updates**
- Shared encoder layers are aggregated on the server.
- Updated global models are broadcasted back to clients for local updates.

### 4Ô∏è‚É£ **Centralized Learning Baseline**
- A centralized model is trained using the aggregated dataset to evaluate performance against the federated approach.

### 5Ô∏è‚É£ **Evaluation and Optimization**
- Metrics: Models are evaluated using **Dice Coefficient** and **Intersection over Union (IoU)**.
- Optimization: Hyperparameter tuning ensures robust performance on non-IID data.
